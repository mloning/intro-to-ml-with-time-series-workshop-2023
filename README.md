# Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series

This is the repository for an "Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series" workshop.

## Overview

You will learn about:

* How to do exploratory data analysis for time series,
* How to identify different time series learning problems,
* How to build machine learning models to solve these problems.

There are various Python packages for machine learning with time series (see this [overview](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/related_software.html)). For this workshop, we're mainly using [aeon], a fork of [sktime]. 

We assume familiarity with the standard tabular machine learning setting covered by [scikit-learn], but no prior experience of working with time series.

[sktime]: https://github.com/sktime/sktime
[scikit-learn]: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

## How to get started

You can run the notebooks on [Binder] without having to install anything.

Alternatively, you can [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository and run the notebooks locally. This requires a working Python installation (e.g. [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)) with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install). Additional requirements are in [.binder/requirements.txt]().
