# Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series

This is the repository for the "Introduction to Machine Learning with Time Series" workshops at [INTERCON](https://intercon.org.pe/) and the [Congreso Internacional de Ingenier√≠a de Sistemas](https://ciis.ulima.edu.pe/) at the [Universidad de Lima](https://www.ulima.edu.pe/) in 2023. 

## Overview

You will learn about:

* How to do exploratory data analysis for time series,
* How to identify different time series learning problems,
* How to build machine learning models to solve these problems.

There are various Python packages for machine learning with time series (see this [overview](https://www.sktime.net/en/latest/related_software.html)). For this workshop, we're mainly using [aeon], a fork of [sktime]. 

The workshop assumes familiarity with the standard tabular machine learning setting covered by [scikit-learn], but no prior experience of working with time series.

## How to get started

You can run the notebooks on [Binder] without having to install anything.

[Binder]: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mloning/intro-to-ml-with-time-series-workshop-2023/main?labpath=notebooks

Alternatively, you can [clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository) this repository and run the notebooks locally. This requires a working Python installation (e.g. [Anaconda distribution](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/)) with [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/install). Additional requirements are in [.binder/requirements.txt](https://github.com/mloning/intro-to-ml-with-time-series-workshop-2023/blob/main/.binder/requirements.txt).

## Feedback

Feedback is highly appreciated. If you've found an error, if I've missed anything or if you want to suggest something new, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/mloning/intro-to-ml-with-time-series-workshop-2023/issues/new/choose).
